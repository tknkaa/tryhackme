# tryhackme

I named this app 'tryhackme' because I thought it might have vulnerabilities, but it's actually a sample full-stack application.\
I intended to use a CSS framework, but I got lazy and didn't write any CSS.

- Frontend: React + Vite + Tanstack Query
- Backend: Elysia + Drizzle
- Authentication: Better Auth
